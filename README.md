# Real Estate Price Prediction model
This project is part of a data science series that walks through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using scikit-learn and linear regression with a home prices dataset from Kaggle.

##Features
 - Build a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression
 - Train the model using home prices data
 - Develop a web interface to predict real estate prices
 - 
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. You can download it here.
